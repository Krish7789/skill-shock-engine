🚀 Overview

Skill Gap Shock is an AI-powered web application that performs a brutally honest skill gap analysis by comparing a candidate’s resume claims against actual demonstrated competency.

The platform simulates how recruiters evaluate candidates in seconds by analyzing technical depth, overconfidence gaps, and real interview readiness, then generates a structured Shock Report with predictions for each hiring stage.

No sugar-coating. Just data-backed reality.

Most candidates:

Overestimate their technical expertise

Don’t know why they fail technical rounds
